TimeBomb v0.4 for BeOS R4.5

This is provided 'as is'.
Remember that this is a Beta release but is quite stable. The Beta state is
more for functionality not stability.

Installation:

1. Unzip the archive
2. Replace any older versions of this program with this newer version, including the config.file.
3. You may want to keep your current sounds folder if this is not your first
   time installing TimeBomb.
4. Enjoy!


Overview:

This program is a desktop alarm clock that has two programmable alarms. The 
alarm can be used in two modes audible and nonaudible. In nonaudible mode 
the displayed time flashes, in audible mode the sound entered in the settings
menu is played or you can specify a CD player and track to play. To add more 
sounds put any BeOS supported sound type (wav, aiff, etc.) in the 'sounds' folder
under the TimeBomb folder. 
NOTE: The sounds should be less than 1 second in length or else each alarm 
ring will overlap the previous ring.
